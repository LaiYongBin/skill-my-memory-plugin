# Memory Usage

## Memory Types

- `fact`: stable personal facts
- `preference`: likes, dislikes, habits
- `rule`: instructions about how to collaborate
- `relationship`: facts about close people
- `project`: longer-lived project context
- `context`: short-lived but important context

## Explicit Promotion

When the user says phrases like:

- 记住
- 不要忘了
- 以后都按这个来

Store the content with:

- `is_explicit = true`
- higher confidence
- higher importance

## Automatic Capture

Safe candidates:

- clearly stated user preferences
- repeated collaboration rules
- stable personal metadata

Unsafe candidates:

- emotional inference
- health judgments
- relationship inference without explicit statement
- ambiguous interpretation

Use lower confidence for unsafe candidates and prefer confirmation.

Current preferred runtime:

- record the raw turn into `conversation_event`
- classify the user turn into `long_term`, `working_memory`, `review_required`, or `ignore`
- persist a structured `memory_analysis_result` first, then decide how to write memory
- persist long-term memory automatically when confidence is high
- persist short-lived task and project context into `working_memory`
- run consolidation periodically to expire or promote memory where appropriate
- prefer asynchronous analysis in normal chat flows so memory capture does not block the main answer

## Candidate Extraction

Current version uses heuristics instead of model inference.

Auto-persist immediately:

- `记住...`
- `不要忘了...`

Auto-persist by default when low risk:

- `我喜欢...`
- `我不喜欢...`
- `以后请...`
- `默认用...`
- `我是一个...的人`
- `我是个...的人`
- `我很...`

Do not auto-persist when content looks sensitive or ambiguous. Keep those as reviewable candidates.

Examples:

- `我对象是不是不爱我了`
- `我最近是不是抑郁了`
- `他是不是讨厌我`

Review actions:

- approve: promote candidate into formal memory and mark candidate approved
- reject: mark candidate rejected without promoting

Extract as candidates first:

- `我喜欢...`
- `我不喜欢...`
- `我习惯...`
- `以后请...`
- `默认用...`
- `我是一个...的人`
- `我是个...的人`
- `我很...`

Working-memory oriented examples:

- `这周先优先排查支付模块的超时问题`
- `当前先别动数据库迁移`
- `最近先按中文输出`

## Vector Retrieval

The system now distinguishes:

- `search_vector`: PostgreSQL full-text index for lexical search
- `memory_embedding.embedding`: pgvector column for semantic retrieval

Hybrid retrieval should prefer:

1. lexical rank and vector similarity
2. explicitness as a small bonus
3. importance and confidence as smaller bonuses
